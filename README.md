# Retail Sales Analytics using Snowflake and Spark

This project showcases a data pipeline that integrates Snowflake and Spark to analyze retail sales data. It uses Snowflake's sample datasets and Spark for data processing, enabling insights that address common challenges in the retail industry.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how businesses can use Snowflake and Spark to:
- Centralize large volumes of retail data.
- Analyze customer behavior and sales trends.
- Improve decision-making through actionable insights.

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses often face challenges such as:
- **Fragmented Data**: Data stored in silos across multiple systems.
- **Slow Analytics**: Difficulty in processing large-scale data for real-time decisions.
- **Lack of Insights**: Insufficient tools for customer segmentation and sales forecasting.

This project provides a solution by building a scalable and efficient pipeline that:
1. Centralizes and processes retail data.
2. Performs advanced analytics on sales trends and customer behavior.
3. Enables easy visualization and reporting for stakeholders.

## Features
- Load and transform retail data using Spark.
- Analyze sales performance and customer segmentation using Snowflake.
- Generate dashboards or reports for visual representation.

## Project Structure
- `scripts/`: Contains data ingestion and pipeline orchestration scripts.
- `data/`: Sample data (if needed locally).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `LICENSE`: License information.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Snowflake account (free trial available)
- Spark
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
